`/build` and `/src` are old. all new stuff is in `/source`, so cd into there before doing anything. i'll delete old content when i feel like i'm in a good place with new setup.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# cd into source foler
cd source

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:1234
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
